# EEG-Sinyal-Detection
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a method used to measure the sudden electrical activity of the brain, this is because neurons in the brain produce electrical signals that are captured by the EEG. In this section, I will explain how to detect muscle artifact signals and ictal signals. The method I use in this chapter is the Support Vector Machine.
