EEG signals contained various signal contamination, one of which is an artifact. Artifact signal is not desirable because it can affect the error in the encoding. The artifact signal itself has various types, but here will focus on muscle artifacts. Muscle artefact signals are selected based on records from medical personnel. The duration of the occurrence of the muscle artefact signal is not as long as the ictal signal. Sometimes, it only occurs no more than two seconds but it appears with a long duration depending on the movements made by object research either intentional or not. Signal cutting has done by cutting signals which only have the characteristics of muscle artefact and ictal signals. Muscle artifact signals have a duration not as long as ictal signals at general seizures. Therefore, the signal is cut for two seconds because it only takes signals which have the characteristics of muscle artifacts and ictal signals.
