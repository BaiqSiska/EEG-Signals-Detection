**EEG Signals**

The data used to support this research is the result of recording human brain signals in the form of EEG signals. The data used in this study came from one of the hospitals in Indonesia.

The data is the result of recording EEG signals by extracranial way using the 10-20 international standard system. The EEG record is performed for 30 minutes. Furthermore, The signal will be selected so that it becomes a single signal data from an electrode with a duration of two seconds with a sampling rate per second that is 500. Therefore a value of 1000 points is obtained. The signal has been filtered with a high pass filter of 70 Hz.
